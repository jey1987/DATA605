```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

$$P(A \cap B)=1/4$$ , $$P(A')=1/3$$ , $$P(B)=1/2$$

The formula is 


$$P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$$

$$P(A') = 1 - P(A)$$
$$P(A) = 1 - P(A')$$
$$P(A)= 1- 1/3$$
$$P(A)=2/3$$

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$$
$$P(A \cup B) = (2/3+1/2)-1/4$$
$$P(A \cup B) = (2/3+1/2)-1/4$$

$$P(A \cup B) = 0.91$$
